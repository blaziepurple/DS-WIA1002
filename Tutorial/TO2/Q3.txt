A raw type is a generic class or interface that has no specified concrete type/does not
have a type parameter.

A raw type is unsafe because it cannot carry out type checks, causing a runtime 
error to occur.

The raw type is allowed in Java because Generics did not exist before JDK 5.0 and 
it exists for backwards compatibility and is mainly found in legacy code.
