My name is Aimaan, matrix number 22119318 and is majoring in Software Engineering. This
is my first time taking the Data Structures subject. At this moment, I'm feeling nervous
and excited cause I'm nowhere near smart but I can (probably) manage :p.

I got a B for FOP last semester (somehow) and I'm hoping I can get the same grade
or even better for this course TwT. I will actually study concepts I don't understand
earlier so I would know what I am doing for once. Let's roll.


Sometime in the future

Hello there
